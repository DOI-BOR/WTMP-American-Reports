# American WTMP Scripts
The HEC-WAT reports folder for the American River within the Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) Water Temperature Modeling Platform (WTMP).
This repository is a dependency of the American WTMP Study repository.
These files create the different types of reports available in the WAT. 

* The *Datasources* directory contains an XML file used in creating the reports.
* The *Format* directory contains XML files that are parts of the final reports.
* The *types* directory contains a folder for each type of simulation. In these folders, there is a CSV for each type of report that can be made.
* There are two XML files that contain defaults for the plotting in the reports.
* There are addition CSV files that are additional reporting combinations.
* The wave.png file goes on the cover page of the reports.

## Usage
### Usage withing the build process
To be added later.

### Post build implementation
After making any desired changes to the code, files must be replaced in the reports folder in a WTMP American Study folder.
